- At least 8GB RAM available
- Ports 8080-8089, 8761, 9090, 3000, 16686 available

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PetClinicService/backend-Clinic
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure Services
```bash
./start-services.sh
```

This script will:
- Start all infrastructure services (databases, Kafka, monitoring)
- Launch all microservices
- Perform health checks
- Display service status and access URLs

### 3. Access Services
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8085
- **Service Registry**: http://localhost:8761
- **Monitoring**: http://localhost:9090 (Prometheus)
- **Dashboards**: http://localhost:3000 (Grafana)
- **Tracing**: http://localhost:16686 (Jaeger)

### 4. Stop Services
```bash
./stop-services.sh
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key configuration files are located in each service's `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

- Database connections
- Kafka broker settings
- Service discovery configuration
- Security settings
- Monitoring endpoints

### Database Setup
The system automatically creates necessary databases and tables on first run. You can also run initialization scripts manually:

```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d petclinic_db -f init-scripts/init.sql

# MySQL
mysql -h localhost -u root -p we_pc < mysql-init/init.sql
```

## üìö API Documentation

### API Gateway Routes
- `/auth/**` - Authentication services
- `/clinic/**` - Clinic and appointment management
- `/donor/**` - Donation services
- `/subscription/**` - Subscription and purchase management
- `/activities/**` - Pet activity tracking
- `/maps/**` - Location and mapping services
- `/accounts/**` - User account management

### Authentication
Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
     http://localhost:8085/clinic/appointments
```

### Public Endpoints
- `/auth/login` - User login
- `/auth/register` - User registration
- `/health` - Health checks
- `/public/**` - Public information

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Checks
Each service provides health endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8085/actuator/health
```

### Metrics
Prometheus collects metrics from all services:
- Application metrics
- JVM metrics
- Database connection metrics
- Custom business metrics

### Logs
Service logs are stored in the `logs/` directory:
```bash
tail -f logs/clinic-server.log
tail -f logs/api-gateway.log
```

### Tracing
Jaeger provides distributed tracing for request flows across services.

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd <service-directory>
mvn test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
mvn verify -P integration-test
```

### API Testing
Use the provided Postman collection or test with curl:
```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'
```

## üîí Security

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in via Auth Server
2. JWT token issued with user claims
3. API Gateway validates tokens for protected routes
4. Downstream services receive user context via headers

### Role-Based Access Control
- **USER**: Basic user operations
- **ADMIN**: Administrative functions
- **VETERINARIAN**: Medical staff operations
- **CLINIC_STAFF**: Clinic management

### Security Headers
The API Gateway adds security headers:
- X-User-ID
- X-User-Role
- X-User-Email
- X-User-Name

## üìà Scaling & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
Services can be scaled independently:
```bash
docker-compose up --scale clinic-server=3
docker-compose up --scale subscription-service=2
```

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session storage
- Application-level caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query result caching

### Load Balancing
API Gateway provides load balancing across service instances using Eureka service discovery.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Won't Start
1. Check if required ports are available
2. Verify Docker is running
3. Check service logs in `logs/` directory
4. Ensure all infrastructure services are running

#### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify database containers are running
2. Check connection strings in `application.yml`
3. Ensure database credentials are correct

#### Kafka Connection Issues
1. Check if Zookeeper and Kafka are running
2. Verify broker addresses in configuration
3. Check network connectivity between services

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting log level to DEBUG in `application.yml`:
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.example.WeePetClinic: DEBUG
```
